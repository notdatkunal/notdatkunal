#### Hi there 👋
 I'm Kunal, a passionate software developer with enthusiasm in Java. I love creating elegant solutions to complex problems and always strive to improve my skills and knowledge.

Currently, I'm working as backend developer. My expertise lies in java,javascript,frontend, design and I have a strong background in maths. I believe in the power of collaboration and open source, and always seek to give back to the community.

In my free time, I enjoy chess and playing guitar. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat about Java. You can also find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/notdatkunal).
